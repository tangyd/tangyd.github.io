Hi, I'm Yudan Tang, a Master student in Statistics at The University of Chicago. I got my Bachelor's degree in Statistics and Computer Science from the University of Hong Kong. During my undergraduate study, I'm fortunate to have Prof. M.S. Stephen as my supervisor and studied the performance of semi-supervised learning algorithm. 

I'm interested in various research topics including Statistical Learning and Computational Statistics. If you wish to contact me, please email me at tangyd.sylvia@gmail.com.
