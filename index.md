Hi, I'm Yudan Tang, a senior student from The University of Hong Kong, majoring in Statistics & Computer Science. I was studying the Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) supervised under Prof. Wentao Li to finish my Bachelor's Thesis one year ahead. Currently, I'm a part-time student research assistant of the department of Statistics & Actual Science at The University of Hong Kong under the supervision of Prof. M.S. Stephen studying the performance of semi-supervised learning algorithm. My related course works include Computational Statistics, Stochastic Statsitics, Time Series, Non-parametric Statistics, Statistical Inference, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Advanced Algorithm, etc. I'm familiar with programming languages like Python, C++/C, R, Java, SQL and VBA. 

I'm interested in topics related the Bayesian Inference and Semi-supervised learning. If you wish to contect me, please email me at tangyd@connect.hku.hk.
